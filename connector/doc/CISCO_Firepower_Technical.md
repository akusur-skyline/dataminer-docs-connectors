# CISCO Firepower

## About

This connector uses SNMP or HTTP communication in order to monitor a CISCO Firepower device. It retrieves fan statistics, monitor statistics, power supply statistics and more. It also provides an overview of how all these components are behaving. It displays the average, maximum and minimum values for specific parameters such as the fan speed and the motherboard input and output current.

## Configuration

#### SNMP connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *private*.
