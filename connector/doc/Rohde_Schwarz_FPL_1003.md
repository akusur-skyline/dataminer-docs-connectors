# Rohde Schwarz FPL1003

## About

The Rohde Schwarz FPL1003 connector allows seamless integration of the FPL1003 compact spectrum analyzer into DataMiner. It provides real-time access to spectrum measurements and device information, making it easy for users to monitor, analyze, and automate RF signal workflows.

## Key Features

- **Real-time spectrum analysis**: View live measurements from 5 kHz to 3 GHz directly in DataMiner.  
- **High-bandwidth analysis**: Supports standard 12.8 MHz and optional 40 MHz analysis bandwidths.  
- **Tracking generator support**: Optional tracking generator up to 3 GHz.  
- **Seamless DataMiner integration**: Monitor multiple spectrum analyzers with centralized control and automation.  
- **Element control and automation**: Easily configure and automate sweep and measurement tasks from DataMiner.

## Use Cases

### RF Lab Monitoring

**Challenge**: Engineers need to monitor RF signals across a wide frequency range without switching between devices.  
**Solution**: Use the connector to integrate the FPL1003 directly into DataMiner for centralized measurement.  
**Benefit**: Saves time and reduces errors by controlling multiple instruments from a single interface.

### Field Testing

**Challenge**: Field engineers need portable spectrum measurements with automated workflows.  
**Solution**: Connect the FPL1003 via TCP/IP to DataMiner for remote access and automated sweeps.  
**Benefit**: Enables quick, reliable measurements without manual intervention.

### Automated Signal Analysis

**Challenge**: Large-scale signal monitoring requires repetitive sweeps and logging for analysis.  
**Solution**: Use DataMiner to automate measurement sequences and retrieve results via the connector.  
**Benefit**: Increases efficiency and ensures consistent data collection.

## Technical Reference

### Prerequisites
- **GPIB interface**: The connector requires a working GPIB connection to the FPL1003.
